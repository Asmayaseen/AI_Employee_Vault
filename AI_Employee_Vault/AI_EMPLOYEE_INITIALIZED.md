## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### For Human (You)

#### Step 1: Review Plans ✅
Read the two plan files created:
1. `/Plans/PLAN_20260205_invoice_processing.md`
2. `/Plans/PLAN_20260205_ahmed_khan_website_update.md`

Both plans are detailed, structured, and follow SpecKitPlus methodology.

#### Step 2: Priority Action - Ahmed Khan Response ⏰
**URGENT:** HIGH priority client request requires response within 1 hour (per Company Handbook).

**What to do:**
1. Review Plan #2 for Ahmed Khan
2. I will create an approval request file shortly
3. Provide Ahmed Khan's email address
4. Approve the information request email
5. Send email manually (no email MCP yet in Bronze tier)

**Timeline:** 50 minutes remaining to meet 1-hour SLA

#### Step 3: Invoice Approval Request 📧
**Non-urgent but important:**
1. Review Plan #1 for invoice processing
2. Provide Client XYZ email address
3. Approve invoice send
4. Send invoice manually

#### Step 4: Approve Constitution & Framework ✅
Review the three framework files:
1. `/sp.constitution.md` - Operating rules
2. `/Prompts/history_context.md` - System memory
3. `/Specs/spec_template.md` - Documentation template

These form the foundation of the AI Employee system.

## 📖 How to Use the System

### Daily Workflow

```
1. Check Dashboard.md → See what's pending
2. Review /Needs_Action/ → See new items detected
3. Review /Plans/ → See AI's analysis and recommendations
4. Review /Pending_Approval/ → Approve or reject proposed actions
5. Move approved files to /Approved/ → Authorize execution
6. Check /Done/ → Review completed work
7. Check /Logs/ → Audit AI actions
```

### Approval Workflow

```
AI detects item → Creates plan → Writes approval request
                                        ↓
                            You review in /Pending_Approval/
                                        ↓
                        Move to /Approved/ or /Rejected/
                                        ↓
                            AI executes (if approved)
                                        ↓
                            AI logs action + moves to /Done/
                                        ↓
                            AI updates Dashboard
```

### Communication With AI

**To give feedback on plans:**
- Edit plan files directly, AI will read your changes
- Add notes in plan files under relevant sections
- Use `/Rejected/` folder with rejection reasons

**To request AI action:**
- Drop files in `/Inbox/` (file watcher auto-detects)
- Create a file in `/Needs_Action/` manually
- Ask Claude directly (for now, until orchestrator built)

---

## 🎓 Learning Mode Active

The AI Employee is now in **Skill Evolution Mode** as defined in the constitution. This means:

### Continuous Improvement ✨
- Every task teaches new patterns
- Every interaction refines intelligence
- Every error improves resilience
- Every approval calibrates autonomy

### Documentation Growing 📚
- `/Prompts/history_context.md` - Updated after each session
- `/Specs/` folder - New specs for each major feature
- `/Logs/` folder - Complete audit trail
- Plans folder - Reasoning artifacts preserved

### Identified Improvements Already 🎯
From Plan #1:
1. Need client database in Business_Goals.md
2. Need invoice templates
3. Need automated PDF generation (future)
4. Need email templates for common scenarios

From Plan #2:
1. Need client request intake form/template
2. Need website access credentials database
3. Need service pricing matrix documentation
4. Need project timeline calculator
5. Need website change QA checklist

These will be implemented incrementally as system matures.

## 🔐 Security Posture

### ✅ Security Measures Active
- HITL required for all sends, posts, payments
- No secrets in plain text (constitution mandates .env)

- Approval workflow enforces human oversight
- Read-only by default, write by approval

### 🔒 Current Security State
- **Credentials:** Properly gitignored
- **Sensitive Data:** None in vault markdown files
- **Access Control:** Human approval gates functional
- **Audit Trail:** Logging framework ready
