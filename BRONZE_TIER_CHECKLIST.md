## 📋 Bronze Tier Requirements

According to 0-hackathon.md, Bronze tier requires:

### 1. ✅ Obsidian Vault with Dashboard and Handbook
- [ ] Obsidian vault created and opens without errors
- [ ] Dashboard.md exists and renders correctly
- [ ] Company_Handbook.md exists with complete rules
- [ ] Business_Goals.md exists with Q1 2026 objectives
- [ ] Folder structure complete (9+ folders)

**How to check:**
```bash
# Check vault exists
ls -la ~/AI_Employee_Vault/ 2>/dev/null || ls -la /mnt/d/Ai-Employee/AI_Employee_Vault/

# Check core files exist
ls AI_Employee_Vault/{Dashboard.md,Company_Handbook.md,Business_Goals.md}

# Check folders
ls -d AI_Employee_Vault/*/
```

**Expected Result:**
- Vault opens in Obsidian ✅
- 3 core .md files exist ✅
- All workflow folders present ✅

---

### 2. ✅ One Working Watcher
- [ ] BaseWatcher class implemented
- [ ] One concrete watcher implemented (Gmail OR Filesystem)
- [ ] Watcher creates .md files in /Needs_Action/
- [ ] Files have valid YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Watcher runs continuously without crashing
- [ ] Watcher logs to /Logs/ folder

**How to check:**

#### If using Filesystem Watcher:
```bash
# Check watcher code exists
ls AI_Employee_Vault/Watchers/base_watcher.py
ls AI_Employee_Vault/Watchers/filesystem_watcher.py

# Check if watcher is running
pm2 list | grep -i "employee\|watcher"
# OR
ps aux | grep -i "watcher.py"

# Test watcher by dropping file
echo "Test at $(date)" > AI_Employee_Vault/Inbox/test_$(date +%s).txt
sleep 5

# Check if action file was created
ls -lt AI_Employee_Vault/Needs_Action/ | head -5

# Check logs
tail -20 AI_Employee_Vault/Logs/*.log
```

#### If using Gmail Watcher:
```bash
# Check watcher code
ls AI_Employee_Vault/Watchers/gmail_watcher.py

# Check credentials setup
ls ~/AI_Employee_Code/credentials/credentials.json
ls ~/AI_Employee_Code/credentials/token.json

# Check if running
pm2 list | grep gmail

# Check logs
pm2 logs ai-employee-gmail --lines 20
```

**Expected Result:**

- [ ] Claude can read files from /Needs_Action/
- [ ] Claude can create files in /Plans/
- [ ] Claude can create files in /Pending_Approval/
- [ ] Claude understands Company_Handbook.md rules

cd AI_Employee_Vault

# Test 1: Read Dashboard
claude "Read Dashboard.md and tell me the current status"

# Test 2: Write to Dashboard
claude "Update Dashboard.md: Add a test entry to Recent Activity with current timestamp"

# Test 3: Process Needs_Action
claude "Check Needs_Action folder. If there are any pending files, create a structured plan in Plans/ folder"

# Test 4: Check Plans created

- [ ] /Needs_Action folder exists (watcher writes here)
- [ ] /Done folder exists (completed work)
- [ ] /Plans folder exists (AI creates plans here)
- [ ] /Logs folder exists (audit trail)

**How to check:**
```bash
# List all folders
ls -d AI_Employee_Vault/*/ | sort

# Verify minimum required
test -d AI_Employee_Vault/Inbox && echo "✅ Inbox exists"
test -d AI_Employee_Vault/Needs_Action && echo "✅ Needs_Action exists"
test -d AI_Employee_Vault/Done && echo "✅ Done exists"
test -d AI_Employee_Vault/Plans && echo "✅ Plans exists"
test -d AI_Employee_Vault/Logs && echo "✅ Logs exists"
```

**Expected Result:**
- All 5 folders exist ✅
- Can read/write to each folder ✅

---

### 5. ✅ All AI Functionality as Agent Skills
- [ ] Skills documented in .claude/skills/ OR skills/ folder
- [ ] At least one working skill for vault setup
- [ ] At least one working skill for watcher setup
- [ ] Skills follow Agent Skills specification

**How to check:**
```bash
# Check .claude/skills/
ls .claude/skills/

# Check skills/ documentation
ls skills/bronze/

# Verify skills are documented
cat .claude/skills/vault-setup.md | head -20
cat .claude/skills/watcher-setup.md | head -20
```

**Expected Result:**
- 4+ skill files in .claude/skills/ ✅
- 2+ detailed skills in skills/bronze/ ✅
- Skills follow standard format ✅

## 🎬 End-to-End Bronze Tier Test

Complete workflow test to verify Bronze tier is functional:

### Step-by-Step Test:

```bash
cd /mnt/d/Ai-Employee/AI_Employee_Vault

# STEP 1: Drop a test file
echo "Test client request for Bronze tier verification" > Inbox/bronze_test_$(date +%s).txt

# STEP 2: Wait for watcher (if running)
sleep 10

# STEP 3: Check if action file created
ls -lt Needs_Action/ | head -3

# STEP 4: Process with Claude
claude "Check Needs_Action folder. Process any pending items by creating a detailed plan in Plans/ folder"

# STEP 5: Verify plan created
ls -lt Plans/ | head -3
cat Plans/PLAN_*.md | head -50

# STEP 6: Check Dashboard updated
grep "Recent Activity" -A 10 Dashboard.md

# STEP 7: Manual completion (no orchestrator yet in Bronze)
# Move processed file to Done
mv Needs_Action/FILE_*.md Done/

# STEP 8: Verify logs (if any)
ls -la Logs/

# STEP 9: Final Dashboard check
cat Dashboard.md
```

### Success Criteria:
✅ File detected by watcher
✅ Action file created in Needs_Action/
✅ Claude created structured plan
✅ Plan includes analysis, steps, approval needs
✅ Dashboard shows activity
✅ File moved to Done/
✅ System stable and operational
